"PI, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, or
3.1415926535 - and this  is just the  beginning. It keeps on going,
forever, without  ever repeating, which means that contained within
this string of decimals is  every single other  number - your birth
date, the  combination to your  locker, your social security number
- its all in  there, somewhere.  And if you convert  these decimals
into letters you would have every word that ever  existed, in every
possible combination - the first  syllable you spoke as a baby, the
name of your latest crush, your entire life story from beginning to
end, everything  we ever  say or  do, all  of the  world's infinite
possibilities  rest within  this one  simple  circle.  Now what you
do with that  information,  what's it's  good for, well, that would
be up to you."
